## baboonctl completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(baboonctl completion zsh); compdef _baboonctl baboonctl

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	baboonctl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_baboonctl"

#### macOS:

	baboonctl completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_baboonctl

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
baboonctl completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
